# Signed Distance Fields (SDFs)

Signed Distance Fields is a way to represent 3D models as implicit surfaces.
to use them in video games you may want to turn them into a mesh.

## Important resources

- [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/) is the godfather of Signed Distance Functions, and have excelent information about them on his site.
