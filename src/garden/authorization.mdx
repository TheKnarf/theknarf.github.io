When building any application you'll need an authorization layer that decides if a user should have access to view / perform an action on any given resource.
Instead of re-inventing this from scratch you can re-use systems to make this easier.

## Traditional Client-Server solutions

- [Cedar](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar)

- [CASL](https://github.com/stalniy/casl)


## Peer-to-peer systems

Peer-to-peer systems may have other requirements than traditional Client-Server solutions.
Here are some relevant libraries / specs:

- [User Controlled Authorization Networks (UCANs)](https://github.com/ucan-wg)

- [Eclipse Biscuit](https://www.biscuitsec.org/)
