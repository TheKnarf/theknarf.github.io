# Datalog

Datalog is a non-turingcomplete logic query language.
It's similar to Prolog, but it being not turingcomplete makes it more declerative,
and means that there's an upper-bound on execution time.
It's interesting as a query language for databases.

## Incremental / differential Datalog variants?

There is [DDlog](https://github.com/vmware-archive/differential-datalog) as an implementation of differential datalog,
but it seems to be "deprecated" having its latest commit in 2022 (Some claime that the team moved on to build [feldera](https://github.com/feldera/feldera)).

One could try and build an implementation on one of these libraries:

- [differential-dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow)

- [dbsp](https://docs.rs/dbsp/latest/dbsp/)

   - [PyDBSP](https://github.com/brurucy/pydbsp) - Python DBSP implementation, with a Datalog implementation

- [salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa)
