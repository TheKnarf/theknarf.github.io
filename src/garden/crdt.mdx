# { frontmatter.title }

Conflict-free replicated datatypes is a set of datatypes that,
unlike Git, guarantees that you can merge them without ever producing a merge conflict.
This seems really powerful, but comes with a few big disatvantages.
CRDT's are very specialiced datatypes with specific trade-offs for how they guarantee to be conflict free.
Their usually really meta-data heavy.
