# Git Cheatsheet

## General tips

- Prefer using `git commit --amend`, this will update the previous commit with your new changes. There is no point in having a bunch of commits that just called "fixes", use amend instead!

<Aside>
VSCode has a button for git commit with amend.

- Set the following global option to make it less likely to screw up stuff[^1]:

```bash
git config --global pull.ff only
```

- If you need to force push then always use `--force-with-lease` (this is more secure than `--force`).

- Use `git status` often so that you know whats going on.

- If you are on Windows check out [Git on Windows](../git-on-windows/).

## Feature branches

### Creating a feature branch

1. First checkout the branch you want to base your feature branch on

2. Then create your new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b name-of-feature-branch
```

3. And once you have a few commits and want to push it up for the first time:

```bash
git push -u origin head
```

### Squash all commits on your feature branch

If you have a lot of commits that you want to squash in your feature branch.

Let's say your development branch is called `main`, then you can run:

```bash
git reset --soft $(git merge-base origin/main head)
git commit
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Update your feature branch

> [!WARNING]
> Never use `git pull` in your own feature branch, its far to easy to screw up your branch this way.


Often you'll need to keep your feature branch up to date with new changes.
You should do this *often* to avoid as many merge conflicts as possible.
If you have a lot of commits then it may be helpful to squash stuff **first** before updating your branch (see above).

Let's say your development branch is called `main`, then you can run:

```bash
git fetch
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease
```

## Advanced tips

- An interactive Git rebase can be used for both squashing and updating your branch, and gives you better control:

```bash
git fetch
git rebase -i origin/main
```

- If you need to move some stuff over to its own PR you can:

  1. Go to your development branch (ex. `git checkout main && git pull`)

  2. Create a new feature branch

  3. Copy inividual files or folder over from your other branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout old-branch-name src/file-or-folder
  ```

  4. Commit them in your new branch & push it up
