# Indoor Air Quality

Bad indoor air quality may make concentration worse as well as exasturbate allergies.
As such I would like to take care to improve air quality, both for my home office and my bedroom.

## Measuring

It's hard to improve what you can't measure, so the first step is to get some sensors.

### Aranet4

I bought the [Aranet4 HOME](https://aranet.com/en/home/products/aranet4-home) to measure CO<sub>2</sub>.
This device works great, the downside is that its a bit pricey.
Preferably I'd get two, one for my bedroom and one for my work enviroment,
for now I started off by just buying one.

I'm using a [Home assistant Yellow](https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow/) as my hub for my smart home.
I would have liked to connect the aranet4 to it, which I think is possible,
but I currently don't have bluetooth on the Home assistant Yellow.

The Aranet4 measured CO<sub>2</sub> but it doesn't measure Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs),
so I'll still need a device for that.

### DIY device

Instead of buying a second Aranet4, I might try and make my own device.
[Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/airgradient-diy-air-quality-monitor-co2-pm25) got a blog post and YouTube video building one that looks good.
