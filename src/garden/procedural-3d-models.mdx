# Procedural 3D models

Gennerating 3D models for games procedurally as code seems interesting.

This can function as the basis for dynamic environments like those found in games like Minecraft and Deep Rock Galactic.
Where you can build and destory the environment.

It could also in theory be used to allow for custom characters like those character creators so many RPG games have.

Types of procgen for 3d models:

  - Marching Cubes / Suface nets (aka Deep Rock Galactic)

  - Heightmap-based terrain

  - CAD Models

Other things to think about:

  - SDFs

  - Random noise

  - Term Rewriting

  - Constraint-based
