# Git on Windows

This is what you want to do if a colleague of yours is using Windows and is having problems with line endings:

```bash
git config set --global core.eol lf
git config set --global core.autocrlf false
```

And then list all config and check that they don't have duplicates (there are often two global config files on Windows for Git):

```bash
git config --list --show-origin
```
