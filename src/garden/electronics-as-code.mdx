# Electronics as Code

In the same lain as `Music as Code` and `CAD as Code`.
Designing electronics as composable modules in code seems like a good idea.

Some tools like that:

- [tscircuit](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit) - Make electronics using Typescript and React

   - [circuit-json](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json) - They also make a spec for storing circuit's as JSON, seems like a nice interchange format between tools.

- [replicad](https://github.com/monostable/replicad) - Design circuits using Javascript/Typescript.

## Circuit simulator's

Being able to simulate circuits would mean that one could do the intitial debugging on your development
machine without having to have the hardware in-front of you yet.

- [CircuitJS1](https://github.com/sharpie7/circuitjs1) - an electronic circuit simulator that runs in the browser

- [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) - "World's most advanced ESP32 simulator"

   - [Wokwi Github](https://github.com/wokwi) - Some of their stuff is open source, but not all it seems

   - [Wokwi Simulator VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Wokwi.wokwi-vscode)
