# Electronics as Code

In the same lain as `Music as Code` and `CAD as Code`.
Designing electronics as composable modules in code seems like a good idea.

Some tools like that:

- [tscircuit](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit) - Make electronics using Typescript and React

- [CircuitJS1](https://github.com/sharpie7/circuitjs1) - an electronic circuit simulator that runs in the browser

- [replicad](https://github.com/monostable/replicad) - Design circuits using Javascript/Typescript.
