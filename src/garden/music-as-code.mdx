# Music as Code

## Idea

I'd like to be able to make music using code.
It sounds like it would be a good idea to be able to share
composing techniques as re-usable functions,
to describe the rythm section declerativly,
to experiment with different musical keys, scales and modes by changing a few lines of code.

### As a live instrument for performance

A lot of the tools I've found seem to fill the nitch of being used for live performance.
Either by actually live coding during the performance, or as a custom instrument develeoped ahead of time.

### As a live instrument for games

I also think it would be interesting with more games where the music is dynamic.
A lot of games will ramp up the intensity when a difficult enemy arrives.
Or have sudden variations on the theme to not seem to repetitive.
As far as I know these are all done ahead of time and "compiled" to static music files (wav / ogg),
but what if they could instead just be a program that reacts dynamicly to the game?

In a similare vein there are so much interesting things that can be done with synths these days,
but again I don't know of any games that feed what happens in a game live into the synth.

## Tools

Her is a list of the tools and libraries I've found.
A lot of these can be used both to create synths as well as whole songs.

Tool | Description
-----|-------------
[Supercollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)|Programming language for "audio synthesis and algorithmic composition"
[Pure Data](https://puredata.info/)|One of the original tools in this space from way back. Eventually became Abelton's Max for Live
[Purr Data](https://www.purrdata.net/)|A modern fork of Pure Data
[Plugdata](https://plugdata.org/)|Another more modern fork of Pure Data
[Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/)|
[Strudel](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel)|A port of TidalCycles to JavaScript
[Csound](https://csound.com/)|
[Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)|
[sapf](https://github.com/lfnoise/sapf)|From the same guy who made Supercollider

Other tools:

- [Heavy Compiler Collection (hvcc)](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc) - `hvcc` is a python-based dataflow audio programming language compiler that generates C/C++ code and a variety of specific framework wrappers.

- [Camomile](https://github.com/pierreguillot/Camomile) - Create audio plugins with Pure Data patches.

  - [DaisySP](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP?tab=readme-ov-file) - DSP Library in C++ for the Daisy

  - [Pollen(8)](https://hammondeggsmusic.ca/daisy/pollen8.html) - _"A full featured 8 voice polyphonic synthesizer for your Electro-smith Daisy pod"_

- [Monome's Norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/) - a small, portable, open-source sound computer that dynamically runs scripts and DSP.

- [uSEQ](https://www.emutelabinstruments.co.uk/useq/) is a eurorack module for livecoding, with its own lisp based programming language called [ModuLisp](https://www.emutelabinstruments.co.uk//modulisp-about/).

## Rust

- [Firewheel](https://github.com/BillyDM/firewheel) - A low-level open source audio graph engine for games and applications, written in Rust.

- [bevy_seedling](https://github.com/corvusprudens/bevy_seedling) - A sprouting integration of the Firewheel audio engine for Bevy.
