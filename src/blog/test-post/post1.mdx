# Test post

The intention of this post is simply to test syntax and embeddings in a blogpost.
This webpage is a React app being built with a custom Vite SSG plugin that I made for the blog.
Each blog post is its own MDX file, supporting normal things that you can do in Markdown (like **bold**, _italic_, `code`, etc).

Each blog post also have its own frontmatter section:

```yml
---
slug: post1
title: Test post
dateWritten: 2024-01-01
---

# Test post
```

Using a plugin this gets converted into an export statement during parse:


```js
export const frontmatter = {
  slug: 'post1',
  title: 'Test post',
  dateWritten: '2024-01-01',
};

# Test post
```

## Tables

GFM should support[^1] footnotes[^2], ~strikethroughs~ and tasklists:

[^1]: This is an example of a footnote.
They can be written in the MDX right where you use them.
But are automatically rendered in the bottom of the document.

[^2]: Easily add as many footnotes as needed.

* [ ] Task 1

* [x] Task 2

Links are automatically turned into links: www.google.com

## Github flavored Alerts

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.

## MDX and React components

Since each post is an MDX file/component then I should be able to simply import and use React components.
So adding a tweet preview is as easy as:

```bash
pnpm add react-tweet
```

And then import and use it:

```jsx
import { Tweet } from 'react-tweet';

# Test post

<Tweet id="1683920951807971329" />
```

<Tweet id="1683920951807971329" />

## Margin notes

Margin notes (often also called side notes) is a common things in physically written text, where (often studens) will take notes on a handout in the margins on the side.
This might serve as an alternative to footnotes.

<Aside>And this is the margin note. Margin notes might be nice to write additional info that a reader might want to note.</Aside>

You should to the right of the paragraph above see a margin note.
Having two margin notes to close together might make them overlap.
I don't have a solution for overlap since I currently just `float` them to the right.

<Aside>

Second aside in the same section.
I'll have to manually ensure that they don't overlap.

</Aside>

I could perhaps using a React portal and CSS Grid create a section for margin notes.
But this brings its own problems; like how to I align it up with the main content?
Margin notes should be coupled to a given section.
