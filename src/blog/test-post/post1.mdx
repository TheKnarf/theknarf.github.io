# Test post

The intention of this post is simply to test syntax and embeddings in a blogpost.
This webpage is a React app being built with a custom Vite SSG plugin that I made for the blog.
Each blog post is its own MDX file, supporting normal things that you can do in Markdown (like **bold**, _italic_, `code`, etc).

Each blog post also have its own frontmatter section:

```yml
---
slug: post1
title: Test post
dateWritten: 2024-01-01
---

# Test post
```

Using a plugin this gets converted into an export statement during parse:


```js
export const frontmatter = {
  slug: 'post1',
  title: 'Test post',
  dateWritten: '2024-01-01',
};

# Test post
```

## Tables

GFM should support footnotes[^1], ~strikethroughs~ and tasklists:

[^1]: Big note.

* [ ] Task 1

* [x] Task 2

Links are automatically turned into links: www.google.com

## MDX and React components

Since each post is an MDX file/component then I should be able to simply import and use React components.
So adding a tweet preview is as easy as:

```bash
pnpm add react-tweet
```

And then import and use it:

```jsx
import { Tweet } from 'react-tweet';
